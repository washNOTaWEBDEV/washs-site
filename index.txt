3:T4c6, plots of land. Now, with centuries of social and economic change along with a plethora of previously unimaginable technological advancements, we have arrived in the digital age. Deemed to be the great equaliser which would bring power back into the hands of ordinary men, the internet emerged, and quickly it became a household essential, accessible to man via his preferred handheld device. Yet, with all these new gadgets at our disposal, we must ponder if anything of significance has changed at all. Comrades, are we not once again slaves to our overlords every time we use a social media site? To Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok—subject to the abitrary constraints and illegitimate rule of technology conglomorates? I daresay, we are landless once again. This is ludicrous. Madness at its finest! Absolutely blasphemous! Where did we go so wrong? Have we become Nietzsche's last man and lost our drive for self-determinism? I have had enough of being a digital landless peasant! I shall revolt and declare this very plot of land right here to be my property and mine alone, where supreme authority over it shall reside eternally in me, and I alone shall dictate the content showcased and their media.
